- Verify leaderboard updates in real-time

âœ… **Verify KV Integration**:
- Scores should persist between page refreshes
- Multiple players should see the same leaderboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **KV Connection Errors**:
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Check KV database is linked to your project
   - Ensure KV database is in the same region as your deployment

2. **Build Failures**:
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review build logs in Vercel dashboard

3. **Game Not Loading**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Canvas API is supported
   - Test on different browsers

### Environment Variables Reference
